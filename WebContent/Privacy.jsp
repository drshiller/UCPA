<H3>Use of Cookies</H3>
A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser
-- along with a web page -- when you access a web site. There are two kinds of
cookies. A session cookie is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your
computer's memory.  Because a session cookie is never written to a hard drive,
it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent cookie is a more
permanent line of text that gets saved by your browser to a file on your hard drive.
Depending on your browser settings, you may receive notification that a given site
is requesting cookie information, possibly with an expiration date.  Persistent
cookies have an expiration date in the future.  Session cookies have no date
associated with them.
<P>
The site will create a session cookie whenever you access the Union County Clerk’s
Office Public Land Records. The session cookie is destroyed as soon as you close
your browser. Union County Clerk’s Office does not create persistent cookies. 
<H3>County Seal</H3>
It is a violation of the law to use the Union County Seal in an unauthorized manner.
It is strictly prohibited for anyone to use the Union County Seal or any other
official logo on the Union County web site to imply an official endorsement,
recommendation, partnership or other relationship with Union County without the
express written consent of Union County.
